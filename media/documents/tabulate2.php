#  CS 4501 AJAX Example -- server script
#  Compare to tabulate.php
#  In this version, before returning we check to see if any new rows
#  have been added to the database.  If so, we return the new data.
#  Since we are using the text return (rather than XML), we must return
#  a single string from this program.  Therefore, to return multiple rows
#  in a table we must concatenate the data so it can then be parsed
#  by the client program.  See more details below.
